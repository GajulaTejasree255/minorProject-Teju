 Title : DYNAMIC STUDENT MANAGEMENT DESIGN

 Abstract :
 The Dynamic Student Management Design project aims to create a web-based
 application that streamlines student data management, specifically focusing on
 placement tracking for faculty and placement teams. The application features a
 responsive interface that enables users to filter and search for student information by
 criteria such as name, roll number, department, and placement status. Filtered results
 are displayed in a structured table format for easy overview.
 A significant feature is the ability to access detailed student information on a dedicated
 page by clicking the student's roll number. This view includes data on academic
 performance, department, and placement details.
 The motivation for this project is to address inefficiencies in managing student
 placement data, which is often scattered across various sources. Unlike the existing
 ECAP website, which provides general student information, this project specifically
 focuses on placement-related needs with advanced filtering, real-time data updates, and
 a scalable solution to enhance decision-making and operational efficiency.
 Ultimately, the project aims to reduce the manual effort in placement data
 management and support the institution in achieving its placement objectives more
 effectively.
